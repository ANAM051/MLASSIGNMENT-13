    "4.Yes, the Naive Bayes classifier can be used on continuous numeric data, but it requires some assumptions and modifications. One way to do this is to discretize the continuous values into bins or categories, such as quartiles, and then apply the Naive Bayes formula on the categorical bins. Another way is to assume that the continuous values follow a certain probability distribution, such as a Gaussian or normal distribution, and then estimate the parameters of the distribution for each class. This way, the probability of a continuous value given a class can be calculated using the density function of the distribution"
